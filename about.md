### Background
Oligomerization in fluorescent proteins (FP) hinders their usage as a marker for protein tagging. The problems include but are not limited to abnormal localization, interfering with signaling cascades and disturing the normal function of tagged proteins. The ability to predict the oligomeric state of FP may help facilitate the production of monomeric FP that are beneficial for life science applications.

### About osFP
osFP is a web application for predicting the oligomeric state of FP input sequences as being either monomeric or oligomeric. A simple and intuitive user interface is provided where users need only provide the sequence data (FASTA format) for FP of interest.

### Tutorial: Using osFP to predict the oligomeric states of FP
osFP is very simple to use requiring only 3 steps as follows: 

1. Paste the input sequences for FP of interest into the input box found below the heading **_Enter your input sequence(s) in FASTA format_**. Alternatively, users can choose to upload the input file of such data by clicking on the **_Choose File_** button.
2. Click on the **_Submit_** button to initiate the prediction process.
3. Prediction results are provided in the gray box found below the **_Status/Output_** heading. Users can also download the results as a CSV file for later use.
